# Project Overview

This single-page application uses React-google-maps and recompose library to render a map onscreen of a neighborhood in Glendale, California along with 8 nearby locations to the map's center. If the branch master is selected, your **current location** will be retrieved along with an additional 8 nearby locations.

The page features 8 map markers of locations near you using the **Foursquare API** , these markers can then be clicked on to reveal further information of these nearby places including a photo and type of place. There is a side pane which lists the names of the 8 locations, each location is clickable to open its corresponding infowindow. The sidepane also has a search box to filter through only the name(s) and the corresponding map marker(s) you wish to see.

# To Get Started

* **1** npm install
* **2** npm run dev (equivalent to npm run start)
* **3** When the markers drop in on the map, click on any of them to reveal further information
